    <img src="/img/Stovetop.png" alt="Stovetop Stuffing Meatloaf">
    <p>Using stovetop stuffing makes meatloaf incredibly savory and the chunks of dried bread create a kind of a tiny mosaic in each slice. With a perfectly thick, sticky and sweet topping this meatloaf is an awesome easy dinner option to whip up any day of the week.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) box chicken stuffing (such as Stovetop)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup ketchup, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8- x 4-inch loaf pan with a double layer of aluminum foil, leaving a 3-inch overhang on the long sides. Lightly coat with cooking spray and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, mix beef, stuffing mix, water, egg, salt, poultry seasoning, and 1/2 cup of the ketchup in a large bowl until evenly combined without overmixing.</li>
        <li>Press into the prepared loaf pan on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and the sides are bubbly, about 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>While meatloaf bakes, whisk together brown sugar and remaining 1/2 cup ketchup in a small bowl until smooth. Remove meatloaf from the oven and spread ketchup mixture evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and continue baking at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of meatloaf registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meatloaf from loaf pan using foil overhang as handles, and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 8 slices.</li>
    </ol>
