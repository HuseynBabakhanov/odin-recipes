# Basic Recipe Website

This project is a simple HTML-based website to practice and reinforce foundational HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page with links to individual recipe pages. It focuses on structure and content rather than design, as styling will be added in future iterations using CSS.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **Index Page (Homepage):**
  - Serves as the entry point of the website.
  - Contains links to individual recipe pages.

- **Recipe Pages:**
  - Each recipe has its own dedicated page.
  - Includes basic information about the recipe, such as ingredients and preparation steps.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Practice HTML Structure:**
   - Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`.
   - Create lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for ingredients and instructions.
   - Add hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to connect pages.

2. **Organize a Multi-Page Website:**
   - Create a directory structure to manage multiple HTML files.
   - Link pages together using relative paths.

3. **Lay the Groundwork for Future Styling:**
   - Focus on clean and readable HTML code that will be styled with CSS in future iterations.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Create a main folder for the project.
   - Add an `index.html` file for the homepage.
   - Add individual HTML files for each recipe (e.g., `recipe1.html`, `recipe2.html`, etc.).

2. **Build the Index Page:**
   - Include a title and a brief description of the website.
   - Add a list of links to the individual recipe pages.

3. **Create Recipe Pages:**
   - Each recipe page should include:
     - A title for the recipe.
     - A list of ingredients.
     - Step-by-step preparation instructions.

4. **Test Navigation:**
   - Ensure that all links between the index page and the recipe pages work correctly.

## Future Enhancements

- Add CSS to improve the visual design and layout.
- Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet users.
- Include images of recipes to make the pages more engaging.

## Notes

This project is part of a learning journey to master web development skills. The focus at this stage is solely on HTML; design and interactivity will be added in later stages.
